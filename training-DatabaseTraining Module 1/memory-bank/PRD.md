# Product Requirements Document - Database Training Course

## Project Vision
Create a comprehensive, hands-on database training course that teaches fundamental database concepts using real-world petroleum industry scenarios. Target audience: business professionals who need practical database skills without computer science theory.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-1: Complete Local Environment Setup
- **Description**: Students can set up SQLite and Python environment on Windows 11
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - PowerShell scripts verify admin rights
  - SQLite binaries downloaded and configured
  - Python dependencies installed and tested
  - Project folder structure created correctly

#### FR-2: Real-World Database Schema
- **Description**: Database represents actual petroleum sales business operations
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Customers table with complete contact information
  - Products table with fuel types and pricing
  - Drivers table with personnel and vehicle data
  - Sales table linking customers, products, and drivers
  - Proper foreign key relationships established

#### FR-3: Data Import Capabilities
- **Description**: Students can import data from multiple sources
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - CSV data import with error handling
  - JSON data import with validation
  - Data cleaning and transformation scripts
  - Database population with sample realistic data

#### FR-4: Progressive Learning Modules
- **Description**: Course structured in logical, incremental modules
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Module 1: Environment setup and verification
  - Module 2: Database creation and schema design
  - Module 3: Data import and manipulation
  - Module 4: Query development and optimization
  - Each module builds on previous concepts

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR-1: Business-Focused Content
- **Description**: All examples relate to real business scenarios
- **Target**: 100% of queries and exercises use petroleum industry context
- **Rationale**: Students learn applicable skills, not abstract theory

#### NFR-2: Self-Contained Learning Environment
- **Description**: Course runs entirely on local machine
- **Target**: Zero cloud dependencies or external services required
- **Rationale**: Works in corporate environments with restricted internet

#### NFR-3: Error-Tolerant Setup Process
- **Description**: Setup scripts handle common configuration issues
- **Target**: 95% success rate on first-time setup
- **Rationale**: Reduces frustration and support requirements

## User Stories

### US-1: Environment Setup
**As a** business professional with limited technical experience  
**I want to** set up a database development environment  
**So that** I can learn database concepts without IT department involvement

### US-2: Sample Data Understanding
**As a** petroleum industry professional  
**I want to** work with realistic fuel sales data  
**So that** I can immediately apply concepts to my work environment

### US-3: Query Development
**As a** operations manager  
**I want to** write SQL queries for business reporting  
**So that** I can generate insights from operational data

### US-4: Data Integration
**As a** business analyst  
**I want to** import data from spreadsheets and external sources  
**So that** I can consolidate information for analysis

## Success Metrics

### Learning Outcomes
- Students can create and modify database schemas
- Students can write complex JOIN queries for business reporting
- Students can import and clean data from external sources
- Students can optimize queries for performance

### Technical Metrics
- Course completion rate > 80%
- Environment setup success rate > 95%
- All sample scripts execute without errors
- Database performance adequate for training datasets

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Windows 11 operating system requirement
- PowerShell execution policy may require adjustment
- Admin rights required for some installation steps

### Business Constraints
- Course content focuses on petroleum industry scenarios
- Local-only deployment (no cloud dependencies)
- Self-paced learning format

### Assumptions
- Students have basic computer literacy
- Students understand fundamental business concepts
- Students have motivation to complete hands-on exercises

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **PowerShell execution restrictions**: Mitigation through clear admin instructions
- **Python version conflicts**: Mitigation through version verification scripts
- **SQLite installation issues**: Mitigation through portable binary inclusion

### Medium Risk Items
- **Data import encoding problems**: Mitigation through UTF-8 standardization
- **Query performance on large datasets**: Mitigation through reasonable sample sizes

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- SQLite binaries (included in project)
- Python 3.x runtime
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Windows PowerShell for automation

### Internal Dependencies
- Sample data files must be created before import scripts
- Database schema must be established before data population
- Module progression follows logical learning sequence

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- Integration with Google Sheets for reporting
- Cloud database migration tutorials
- Advanced performance optimization
- ETL pipeline development

### Long-term Vision
- Multi-industry dataset options
- Interactive web-based tutorials
- Integration with business intelligence tools
- Certification program development
